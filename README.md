# FileShare 
FileShare is a basic File Server created using Node JS and Android Java to file sharing and download. You can download the FileShare App and scan the QR Code to easily browse files or you can also use the Web Interface. You can easily start an NGROK server by adding your NGROK key in the CLI command. There is also an API version for you to create your own File Server App.
